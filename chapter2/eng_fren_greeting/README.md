# English / French Greeting

A small go project that returns greeting based on the selected language.

# New Learning
- switch statements
- unit testing every possible out put of the switch
- using go cover to see how much of the test is covered
- go does not test main, so I was having issues why my test coverage was stucked at 66.7%

# Supported language
- 'en' -> Hello, world
- 'fr' -> Bonjour le monde
- default -> empty string

# Running the program
make run

# Running the test
make test

# Running the coverage 
make cover

# Clean up
make clean
