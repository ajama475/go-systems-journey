# go-systems-journey

This repository documents my journey learning Go with a focus on systems, cloud, and infrastructure-level programming.

I am using *Learn Go with Pocket-Sized Projects* as a foundation, but the goal here is not just to follow along but it is to understand how concurrency, networking, and service design work in real-world backend and cloud environments.

Each project explores concepts that show up in production systems such as:

- worker pools  
- concurrent services  
- HTTP / TCP servers  
- rate limiting  
- load balancing  
- graceful shutdown  
- task scheduling  

These are the kinds of problems that exist behind APIs, inside cloud platforms, and within distributed systems.

This repo is intended to serve as a documented progression from basic Go syntax toward building small system-level components that resemble real infrastructure patterns.
